            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Map with states</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Area</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Horizontal bar with the electoral vote count</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Area</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Colors representing the presidential candidates political parties (red for republican party or blue for democratic party)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color</li>
                    <li>Good choice because each color represents a distinct political party so it makes it easy to follow</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Horizontal bar representing electoral votes</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Position</li>
                    <li>Shape</li>
                    <li>Good choice because it shows which candidate is winning by having surpassing the electoral votes needed to win and having it be horizontal makes it easy to follow right above the corresponding map</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Map of the US</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shape</li>
                    <li>Area</li>
                    <li>Good choice because having each state represented as blue or red makes it easy to see which candidate has won more states and also which states vote primarily towards one party or the other</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Colormap(s)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Categorical</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red and blue represent distinct political parties</li>
                    <li>Good choice because red and blue represent the two political parties which the two presidential candidates belong to so the divergent color scale makes it easy to follow</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 dashes lined which represent fly balls, line drives, ground balls</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Points representing the scoring value of botted balls</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a color scale for the points which represent the scoring value (purple being below average, white being average, and orange being above average)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color</li>
                    <li>Good choice because it made the visual easy to follow since the purple and orange were two distinct colors which represented below average or above average, respectively. Having the midpoint be white also made the scale easy to follow.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>The 3 lines are dashed and have small widths</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Size</li>
                    <li>Good choice because the small dashes dont cover too much of the visual but are prominent to see the line</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>The 3 lines are vertical in direction</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Position</li>
                    <li>Good choice because you you can see where the points lie relative to the 3 distinct launch angles at 50 degrees fly balls, 25 degrees line drives, 10 degrees ground balls</li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>The points are circular</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shape</li>
                    <li>Good choice because points should be conventionally circular</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Colormap(s)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Divergent</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ordered ordinal attribute</li>
                    <li>Good choice because it represents a scale from below average to average to above average where average is the “mid point” and is white in color</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
